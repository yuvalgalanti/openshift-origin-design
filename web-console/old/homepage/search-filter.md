# Search and Filter

- The search bar is located at the very top of the web console homepage
- This component enables users to enter a query and receive a list of results.

- The search bar is sticky at the top of the page.

- As the user scrolls, the search will remain at the top with a portion of the background image still visible.

## Search Catalog

![search](img/search-03.png)
- Entering a search term brings up a list of the first five matches.
- The matches display the catalog item icon, name and any relevant tags.
	- Clicking on a match will trigger the order flow for that catalog item on the [overlay panel](../patterns/overlay-panel.md).


#### Implementation Details
- Catalog items will be able to be searched by (in descending order of importance):
	1. Display name
	2. Tag
	3. Description (short and long)
- The five results shown underneath the search bar should be weighted to show the most relevant results first.
- No results will be highlighted until the up or down arrow key is pressed.
- Pressing the `Enter` key while no results are selected will trigger the `View all results` action (see below for details)
- If possible and practical, the search results panel should be updated as the user enters their search term.


## View All Results
![search](img/search-04.png)
- Clicking on the `View All [n] Results for Keyword:[searchterm]` link scrolls the user down to the [catalog](./catalog.md) on the `All Categories` tab with an active "Keyword" filter for the search term.

#### Implementation Details
- All active filters are cleared when the main search box is used so that it always produces a "fresh" page of results.
- Additional keyword filters may be added by using the keyword filter box (see below for details).
- Navigating to a different tab will clear the active keyword filter.

#### Customer Feedback (if applicable)
- Necessary Customer Feedback
- Is it clear that the keyword filter is a direct result of entering a search term?

## Filtering within a page
![search](img/search-06.png)
- Users may narrow the items displayed on a catalog page by applying additional filters from the filter dropdown.
- The keyword filter box creates an active keyword filter which displays only items with a Display Name, Tag, or Description (short or long) that matches the keyword.
	- Unlike the main search bar, Filters are applied to the currently active page rather than taking the user to the `All` category page.
	- Typing a new term into this box will add a new keyword filter to the current page with an AND relationship to the previous keyword filter.
- Filter checkboxes enable users to quickly add and remove filters within different categories
	- Filters added from separate sections are combined with an AND relationship.
	- Filters within the same section are combined with an OR relationship (e.g. show me services that are free OR billed monthly).
	- If possible, filter categories should only show up to five filters at a time with a `show more` link to reveal the rest of the list.
- Clicking outside of the filter dropdown should close the dropdown.

## Rules for active filters
![search](img/search-07.png)
- Filters exist only within the scope of the currently selected category and subcategory and their behavior reflects this:
	- Filters do not persist when a different category or subcategory tab is selected.
	- Filters are not saved on the page for when the user navigates back to a category or subcategory tab (Using the browser's back button should restore the state of the previous page including filters, however).
	- An active filter that yields 0 results in a given category or subcategory must not cause the tab to disappear. This is true for the currently selected tab as well as other tabs.

#### Implementation Details
- If it is possible to determine the number of items that match a given filter, that number should be displayed next to each filter in a list.
- If it is possible to determine that the current keyword filter constrains the page's contents to a single other category or subcategory, filters for that category should be shown instead.
- In the short term, standard PatternFly filter token styling may be used.
	- Ultimately, these tokens should be updated to match the below mockup
