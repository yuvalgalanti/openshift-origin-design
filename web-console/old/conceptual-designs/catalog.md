# Catalog Filtering and Subcategory Redesign
- Changing requirements and feedback mean that the design of current OpenShift catalog is no longer sufficient for our needs.

## Use Cases
1. As an OpenShift user, I want to:
  - Easily find items that fit my requirements in a catalog that could contain hundreds of entries
  - Filter existing items by an indefinite number of criteria to find suitable items when I may not have a good knowledge of all possibilities
  - Easily find resources that my cluster admin has added for my use

## Design
- [The Invision prototype linked here includes designs and flows for the use cases described above.](https://redhat.invisionapp.com/share/JQG1OSYS5C8#/281548520_subcategories_1)
