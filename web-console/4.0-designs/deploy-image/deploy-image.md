  * The Deploy button will be disabled until a user has completed the form without any errors
  * Cancel will bring the user back to the page they were previously on

**All Projects selected**

  * The resource name for successful creations will link users to that resource's overview page
* Failed creations will be displayed with the pficon-error-circle-o to the left and a recommendation on how the user can remedy the error
* Users may also go to the project overview page using the link or go back to the page they were previously on using the Close button
